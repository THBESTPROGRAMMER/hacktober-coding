Contributing to open Source during hacktober2020

# Every October the Hacktoberfest invites all people to participate. 
# The mission is very clear. Become active in the open source community. But how exactly does it work?


## ðŸ”¨ How to Hacktober
## [1] : 
Participating in the Hacktoberfest is very easy.

## [2] :
From the 1st until the 31st October it will be possible to register at hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. 
For now you can subscribe to a newsletter that, that keeps you up to date.

## [3] :
Find some open source projects that you think are interesting and look at their issues.
You should definetly estimate if you have the right skills to resolve the open issue. 
The good thing is, there are some tools which could help you to find some projects.
Take a look at awesome-for-beginners or up-for-grabs.net. I found these resources at the Hacktoberfest website. There are even more resources, especially for beginners.

## [4] : 
When you found the right project and some issues which are probably tagged with the label good first issue, you are ready to start.
All you need to achieve in this month are four pull requests


# HAPPY CODING !!
